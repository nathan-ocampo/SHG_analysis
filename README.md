# SHG_analysis
Scripts that speed up data analysis for SHG imaging of E5 chick hearts

Script tips:
Download anaconda(https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) and run using spyder, the script was written in spyder in a conda enviroment 
so standalone spdyer programs may not work

You can eliminate the lines related to user input. You can hard code file path in the line that asks for a file path. There is also a user input that asks for z slices, so just
be careful if you hard code other parts of the user input
